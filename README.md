# Final project



TODO: 
- Make sure that all the data is in this repo, some of it is still in the other private repo now! 不好

- add this for all of the candidates https://github.com/Jasper-Hewitt/privatestuff/blob/main/Chiang_overtime_plot.ipynb. maybe also put them next to each other. Also try to figure out how to make it bigger!! JUST TAKE DATE INTO BERT LIKE I DID HERE https://github.com/Jasper-Hewitt/privatestuff/blob/main/ChiangWanan_Twitter_predict_unlabelled_data.ipynb. That appears to be no problem.

- add a twin positive Y axis or something, see chat with owen, screenshot, and this link that Owen sent me https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19952290/how-to-align-the-bar-and-line-in-matplotlib-two-y-axes-chart



Final project data science. 
Total data collected through scraper: 5113 （蔣萬安：1476， 黃珊珊：1688， 陳時中：1950）

I also added 高虹安: 1850. This would bring the total to: 6963

to-do put everything in one notebook and try to make a cool graph that combines all the findings into one figure
